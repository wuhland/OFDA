   As children growing up in Kenya, Georgine Auma and Natha Yare were excluded from their right to education.
  </p>
  <p>
   Why? Because they are deaf. Access to education in sign language is

    still denied
   </a>
   to millions of deaf and hard of hearing children, and even those who are lucky to receive an education &mdash; like Georgine and Natha &mdash; often lack teachers or specialists adequately trained in sign language, causing children to miss early language acquisition milestones that assistive devices like cochlear implants or hearing aids cannot provide.
  </p>
  <p>
   For Natha, being deaf meant she couldn&rsquo;t go to a local school, and instead attended a school for the deaf 15 hours away by bus. Even there, though, Natha was denied her right to a quality education.
  </p>
  <p>
   &ldquo;The government decided to introduce new teachers that knew no Kenyan Sign Language; these teachers filled blackboards with words and gestured for us to copy,&rdquo; Natha said. &ldquo;When we finished, we felt like we accomplished something. Afterwards, we went outside to run and play, not understanding what was copied.&rdquo;
  </p>
  <p>
   In many countries like Kenya, social stigma causes parents and community members alike to perceive deaf and hard of hearing children as impaired or altogether unable to learn.

   When Georgine became deaf at the age of 9, her parents didn&rsquo;t know what to do with her. Although she already had a strong language foundation, her parents kept her from school for a full year before deciding to re-enroll her equipped with what they believed was a solution: hearing aids.
  </p>
  <p>
   &ldquo;I returned to the same school I was in before &mdash; needless to say, I never understood a thing taught in class,&rdquo; Georgine said. &ldquo;As a coping mechanism, I developed a love for books and literally read everything I could. Reading helped me stay within the top three of my class.&rdquo;
  </p>
  <p>
   Georgine recounted struggling with isolation and an identity crisis while growing up. &ldquo;I thought I was the only deaf person in the world until I discovered Kenyan Sign Language at Maseno School for the Deaf,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There, I finally found my identity and felt a sense of belonging.&rdquo;

   USAID&rsquo;s Commitment to Access and Inclusion
  </h3>
  <p>
   When I hear stories like Georgine and Natha&rsquo;s, it takes me back to Kenya, where I worked at two schools for the deaf as a Peace Corps volunteer. The challenges faced by deaf and hard of hearing people are still prevalent, though; I recently attended the quadrennial World Federation of the Deaf conference, where over 100 deaf youth representatives echoed the same themes of barriers to sign language and education.

  <p>
   USAID is working to change this, providing access to education and sign language around the world. Education projects promoting sign language have been implemented in countries including Ecuador, Georgia and Morocco.
  </p>
  <p>
   USAID partnered to produce Ecuador&rsquo;s first-ever sign language dictionary, and with the current

   Grand Challenge initiative, the Agency is developing revolutionary software to support bilingual education in Morocco and Georgia. In

    Morocco
   </a>
   , with early grade reading software using both Moroccan Sign Language and Arabic, deaf students have been shown to develop better literacy skills, learn better, and thinking more outside of the box than they did before.
  </p>
  <p>
   Inclusive education is becoming an important theme on the global stage. It is important to ensure that students like Georgine or Natha aren&rsquo;t left behind. Quality education for deaf and hard of hearing students means equipping teachers with fluency in sign language, thus creating truly inclusive spaces for all learners &mdash; because every child has a right to be educated.
