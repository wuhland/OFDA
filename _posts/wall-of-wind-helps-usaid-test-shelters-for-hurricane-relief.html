   <em>
    Hurricane Preparedness Week is May 26 through June 1, following the release of the official forecast for the 2013
    <strong>
     &nbsp;
    </strong>
    Atlantic hurricane season. This week, USAID is highlighting the work we do to help disaster-prone countries prepare for and recover from hurricanes.

  </p>
  <p>
   There is a place in Miami, Florida, where deadly, hurricane force winds can be felt year-round without the threat of destruction.&nbsp; In fact, it&rsquo;s a place that&rsquo;s being used to help save lives.
  </p>
  <p>
   It&rsquo;s called the Wall of Wind, a cutting-edge lab at
   <a href="http://www.usaid.gov/cgi-bin/goodbye?http://wow.fiu.edu/" target="_blank">
    Florida International University (FIU)
   </a>
   that can simulate hurricane conditions using 12 giant fans, stacked two high, capable of generating winds with speeds exceeding 150 miles per hour, packing the punch of a Category Five storm.

   is working with FIU to harness these hurricane force winds to test the strength and design of transitional shelters. Transitional shelters are not tents, but they&rsquo;re not quite houses, either. They are a mix of the two, constructed using new and salvaged building materials to safely house people who&rsquo;ve been hit hard by disasters until they secure a permanent home.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hurricanes can be catastrophic, uprooting communities, taking out entire coastlines, and killing thousands of people in the process. Flying debris&mdash;often from pieces of roofs and homes&mdash;contributes to being one of the most deadly and destructive side effects of these storms.
  </p>
  <p>
   This is why it&rsquo;s crucial that transitional shelters are strong enough to withstand nature&rsquo;s worst, and that is where the Wall of Wind comes into play. Take a look at the video, and see for yourself if a transitional shelter constructed with USAID-identified best practices could really stand up to a hurricane.

   The transitional shelter was blasted by wind speeds of more than 100 miles per hour&mdash;well in excess of a Category One hurricane&mdash;and remained standing.&nbsp; USAID&rsquo;s work with the Wall of Wind not only helps improve the quality of emergency shelters, it can also have a real impact on the way future homes and businesses are built in hurricane-prone areas.
