   What is the first thing you picture when you hear someone talk about parrots? A bird on a pirate&rsquo;s shoulder? &ldquo;Polly want a cracker?&rdquo; Or maybe an image of beautiful, colorful feathers? But parrots are more than just eye candy and pirate paraphernalia. Parrots ensure forests grow, help communities develop eco-tourism, and serve as symbols of national pride.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Flourishing Forests
  </h3>
  <p>
   Parrots are critical to the health of the forest ecosystems where they live. As fruit and seed eaters and dispersers, parrots scatter seeds and help forests continue to flourish. In Guatemala, the Maya Biosphere Reserve, part of the largest tropical forest north of the Amazon, is home to the majority of Guatemala&rsquo;s endangered scarlet macaw population and an amazing array of plant and animal life.
  </p>
  <p>
   To help protect these beautiful birds, USAID partners with local communities and non-governmental organizations like the

   to conserve these important forests. Because of these efforts, we now see scarlet macaws multiplying throughout this unique reserve.
  </p>

  <h3>
   Talking Ecotourism
  </h3>
  <p>
   Parrots are a main draw for eco-tourism. The revenues, in turn, support local livelihoods and provide funds to manage protected areas and wildlife conservation. In Colombia, USAID partners with the
   <a href="https://www.audubon.org/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.audubon.org/', 'Audubon Society');">
    Audubon Society
   </a>
   to develop a parrot tourism program in the Caribbean. By training community members on how to work as birding tour guides and develop birding trails, the project provides an income to local individuals while protecting parrot habitat.
  </p>

  <h3>
   Community Conservation
  </h3>
  <p>
   In Nicaragua, coastal development, expanding agriculture, and poaching has reduced the habitat of the yellow-naped parrot. With the support of USAID and other conservation partners,
   <a href="http://www.pasopacifico.org/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pasopacifico.org/', 'Paso Pac&iacute;fico');">
    Paso Pac&iacute;fico
   </a>
   works to conserve this endangered species through tourism and environmental education. Through work with communities and environmental education for children, these efforts led to greater understanding of parrot populations, including threats from wildlife trafficking and the pet trade.
  </p>

   Illegal Pet trade of Parrots
  </h3>

   Unfortunately, parrots are often part of wildlife trafficking, which is frequently connected to the illegal trade of drugs, arms and humans. People enjoy them as pets but often are unaware that they may be illegally obtained and traded, contributing to the smuggling business. Protecting wildlife helps keep the peace in communities and reduce profits from illegal activity.
  </p>
  <p>
   According to the Wildlife Conservation Society, 259 out of 355 species of parrots are in international trade and nearly 30 percent are almost extinct due to wildlife trade. The scarlet macaw population in Honduras, Guatemala, Mexico and Belize have been reduced to small, isolated populations. African gray parrots in Central and West Africa are going extinct, with about a fifth of the global population captured for trade each year.
  </p>
  <p>
   USAID&rsquo;s work to conserve parrots in Guatemala, Brazil, Nicaragua, Colombia and elsewhere help to protect the birds, support local livelihoods, and conserve important forest ecosystems.

   Next time you think about pirates or parrots, remember that these beautiful birds do a lot more than mimic our words!
